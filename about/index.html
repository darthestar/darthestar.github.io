        <h3><i>Paving the way to make my mark in Software Developement...</i></h3>

        <p>In 2016 I left my longtime career to follow my passion in technology.
          Coding brought out the best in my abilities.
          So I spent months working my way through an intensive developer bootcamp.</p>
        <p>Upon completion, I surged into 2017 with the skills to build web applications. The fast paced nature of this industry and the constant learning opportunities fed my motivation.
           I am only beginning this journey, but am determined to catupult into technical success, can't wait to see what the future holds!!</p>
