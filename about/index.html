        <h3 ><i> My path into Software Development...</i></h3>

        <p>In 2016 I left my longtime career to follow my passion in technology.
          Coding brought out the best in my analytical abilities.<br>
          For that reason, I spent months learning and completing an intensive developer bootcamp.<br>
        Upon graduation, I surged into 2017 with the skills to build web applications. I am constantly motivated by the fast paced nature of this industry and the constant learning opportunities.
           <br>This is only the beginning of my journey, but am determined to catupult into technical success with the right company and opportunity.  I can't wait to see what the future holds!!</p>
