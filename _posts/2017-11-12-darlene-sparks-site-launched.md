Oh happy day, my website is up and running.  I can barely contain my enthusiasm for the ideas I have in mind for it's future. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. I love the functionality options, it really drives the desire to use my creativity.
