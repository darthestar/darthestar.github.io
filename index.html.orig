        <h1>Darlene Sparks</h1>
          <h2><i>Software Developer</i></h2>
        <p>This past year I decided to pursue my longtime career goal to be a software developer. I was very intrigued that code could be used to produce programs, and improve services and lives. I researched many schools and enrolled in a rigorous coding bootcamp that required many months of independent study and testing. Upon completion, I acquired the knowledge and programming skills to be a full stack developer.  Now I can build functional end to end web applications. I love the fast paced nature of this industry and the constant learning opportunities. My tenaciousness sometimes keeps me up late because of my determination to find answers and complete projects.
          To see my program working is the one of the best feelings! Being a highly driven, self-motivated person, I feel comfortable in this fast paced environment.  I am currently seeking
          employment in a company where I can be a contributing developer, growing alongside experienced colleagues.  Ultimately, one day I would like to build a useable product or service of my own.
